Description: This package provides a function to calculate a quality score 
for each iteration based on the output created in F2 and identifies 
the optimal number of iterations post-hoc. Exponents can be modified 
in the function to customize the quality score calculation. 
The function also generates a plot of the quality score at each iteration.
