# ChatGPT:
# A test typically doesn't make sense for this specific code snippet because it primarily consists of data retrieval and manipulation code. Tests are typically used to validate the behavior and correctness of functions or methods in a package.
#
# In this code:
#
# - Data is being downloaded from an external source (Glottolog).
# - The downloaded data is read into a data frame (`glottolog_languoids`).
# - Temporary files are used for the download process, and they are cleaned up afterward.
#
# Since there are no functions or methods with specific behavior to test here, writing a unit test for this code wouldn't provide meaningful information about the correctness of your R package. Instead, this code is more suitable for inclusion in the package's documentation or vignettes to explain how to access and use the `glottolog_languoids` dataset.
