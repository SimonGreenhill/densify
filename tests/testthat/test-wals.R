# The code you provided is primarily focused on data retrieval, transformation, and formatting, and it doesn't contain specific functions or logic that can be tested using unit tests. Therefore, similar to the previous case, writing a unit test for this code snippet may not be suitable.
#
# The code downloads data from an external source, processes it, and creates a dataset (`wals`) by merging different data frames and performing data manipulation steps. While this code is essential for preparing the dataset used in your R package, it doesn't have individual functions or methods with distinct behaviors to test.
#
# You can include this code in your package's documentation or vignettes to explain how to access and use the `wals` dataset.
